# Menrva
Audio Effect Engine supporting Plug'n'Play style DSP Effects

## Description
The goal of this project is to allow end users to easily tune the audio produced by their Device using powerful Digital Signal Processing algorithms.  The Core Engine is designed for cross-platform compilation to support a wide-range of devices and environments.

## Effect Lists

### Implemented Effects
  - Bass Boost

### Effects In Progress
  - N/A

### Planned Effects
  - Master Limiter
  - Stereo Widening
  - 15+ Band Equalizer

## Requesting an Effect
To request an effect open a GitHub Issue describing the effect which you would like.  Providing an open source implementation, algorithm, formula and/or any other documentation which may help in creating the effect is greatly appreciated.  Please note that I am not a mathmatician or electrical engineer and my background is mainly software engineering and development, so providing explanations or documentation which a computer scientist or engineer can understand will help speed up the process.

## Contributing
See [CONTRIBUTING](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) document for details on building and contributing to the Menrva Projects.

## Special Thanks
Huge thanks goes out to all of the XDA Audio Mod developers out there and their projects for inspiring me to start my own.  An even bigger thanks goes out to those developers that Open Source their DSP algorithms so the rest of us can use them.  Hopefully this is a complete list, if not please contact me :
