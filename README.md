# Special Thanks
Huge thanks goes out to all of the XDA Audio Mod developers out there and their projects for inspiring me to start my own project.  An even bigger thanks goes out to those developers that Open Source their DSP algorithms so the rest of us can use them.  Unlikely that this is a complete list :
